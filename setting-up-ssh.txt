run ssh-keygen to create a public and private key pair and create and copy to
.ssh directory
ssh-keygen
ls -la .ssh
Then one needs to ssh-add this to tell ssh all about it, this has to be done
with ssh agent running

Once ssh agent is running then we can add ournewly created keys to it.
I had to manually run ssh-agent after creating keys
but its recommended to put this in your bash profile.


ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub
ls
hg clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/pobept63/dotfiles
