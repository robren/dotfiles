The plugins are in the bundle directory 

Will use a different directory with vim-plug

Do not need:

- Fuzzy finder, look at the fzf package integration
- Abolish, a spell checker fixer for typoss, maybe but not needed now
- L9 some vim script helper modified 9 years ago !
- Ctrlp. Yet another fast fuzzy file finder. Devide on fzf ingation vs others
- taboo Makes tabs look good. Maybe re add if I see a need
- vim-go

Investigate for adding back
- ucompleteme
- vim-obession Tim poses session management

Will keep or rather install fresh

- nerdtree
- vim-airline
- vim-better-whitespace  Shows the trailing whitespace as red
- vim-buffergator Buffer management, The leader b package
